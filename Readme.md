Renewable Energy Forecasting Dashboard

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing how renewable energy production compares with forecasted values across different regions and energy sources.

I created this dashboard to understand forecasting accuracy in the energy sector and to find trends that could be useful for companies, governments, or sustainability teams trying to optimize production.

### Why I Built This

Forecasting is critical when managing renewable energy. Overproduction can waste resources, while underproduction can cause shortages and financial loss.

I wanted to explore how close real-world production is to forecasts and highlight where the gaps are.

### What’s Inside the Dashboard

- 📈 A clean monthly comparison between forecasted and actual production
- 📊 Custom KPIs like:
   - Difference in production
   - Percentage error
- 🧭 Interactive slicers to filter by region or energy source
- 🟢 A visual showing total CO₂ offset
- 🧠 An insights page that includes:
   - Top 3 months of overproduction
   - Best performing region
   - Average forecast error (as a clean KPI card)

---

### Tools I Used

- Power BI  
- Power Query (for data cleaning and calculations)  
- DAX (to calculate average forecast error cleanly)

---

### Storytelling Page

I also added a “Summary” tab that briefly explains the project purpose and KPIs, so someone seeing it for the first time knows what to focus on.

Thanks for checking this out. If you have feedback or suggestions, I’d love to hear them!
