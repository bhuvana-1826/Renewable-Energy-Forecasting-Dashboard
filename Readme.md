Renewable Energy Forecasting Dashboard

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing how renewable energy production compares with forecasted values across different regions and energy sources.

I created this dashboard to understand forecasting accuracy in the energy sector and to find trends that could be useful for companies, governments, or sustainability teams trying to optimize production.

### Why I Built This

Forecasting is critical when managing renewable energy. Overproduction can waste resources, while underproduction can cause shortages and financial loss.

I wanted to explore how close real-world production is to forecasts and highlight where the gaps are.

### What‚Äôs Inside the Dashboard

-  A clean monthly comparison between forecasted and actual production
-  Custom KPIs like:
   - Difference in production
   - Percentage error
-  Interactive slicers to filter by region or energy source
-  A visual showing total CO‚ÇÇ offset
-  An insights page that includes:
   - Top 3 months of overproduction
   - Best performing region
   - Average forecast error (as a clean KPI card)

---

### Tools I Used

- Power BI  
- Power Query (for data cleaning and calculations)  
- DAX (to calculate average forecast error cleanly)

---

### Storytelling Page

I also added a ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù tab that briefly explains the project purpose and KPIs, so someone seeing it for the first time knows what to focus on.
